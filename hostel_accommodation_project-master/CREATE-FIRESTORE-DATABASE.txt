🔥 CREATE FIRESTORE DATABASE - URGENT FIX
==========================================

## THE PROBLEM
Your Firebase project exists, but the Firestore database hasn't been created yet.

## THE SOLUTION (5 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click on your project: "hostel-accommodation"

### Step 2: Create Firestore Database
1. In the left sidebar, click "Firestore Database" (or "Build" → "Firestore Database")
2. Click the "Create database" button
3. Choose "Start in TEST MODE" (for now)
4. Click "Next"
5. Select location: Choose closest to you (e.g., "us-central" or "europe-west")
6. Click "Enable"
7. Wait 30-60 seconds for database to be created

### Step 3: Set Security Rules (Important!)
Once database is created, click "Rules" tab and paste this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write to all for testing
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Publish"

### Step 4: Verify It Works
1. Go back to your login page
2. Refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check console - you should see:
   ✅ Created: ID 123456 (password: student123)
   ✅ Created: ID 999999 (password: warden123)

### Step 5: Login
- ID: 123456
